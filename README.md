# Resources-for-learning-Linux-ricing-
I will try to add all the useful resources, software, tips, articles, github-repos with dotfiles etc for easy learning. 

This repo is mainly for me to have ONE place to easily
find my notes, resources on Linux-ricing,
how to set up a DE or WM from the ground up.

I am bad at organizing so this is my best attempt
to change that. I will put all the sites, githubs, etc
that's relevant to my SICK SICK obsession with
trying to learn how to rice my desktop.

DAMN YOU r/unixporn! ðŸ˜‚
