Xinit is a handy program thats normally 
used to start WMs and DEs.
 Startx is a frontend script for this.

Where is the script that starts the WM?? 

“~/.xinitrc is handy to run programs depending 
on X and set environment variables on X server startup.
 If it is present in a user’s home directory,
 startx and xinit execute it.
 Otherwise startx will run the default /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.” - From Arch-wiki
